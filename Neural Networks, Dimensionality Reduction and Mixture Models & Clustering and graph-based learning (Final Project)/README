In Task 1, I explored how a neural network architecture and techniques for dimensionality reduction performed on a set of images 
from the MNIST dataset. This dataset consisted of two files: a training set with 6000 images (file MNIST_train.csv) and a test set with 
1000 images (file MNIST_test.csv). Each image was 28 x 28 pixels, encoded as an array of size 784. The images represented handwritten digits
from 0 to 9, so they belonged to 10 different classes (the column ‘Label’ indicated the class of each image). The dataset was well balanced,
i.e., it had 600 images of each class in the training set and 100 images of each class in the test set. First, I trained a feed-forward neural
network to classify images; then, I performed image denoising through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), 
and modeled the data as a Gaussian Mixture.

In Task 2, I worked on a dataset reporting measurements of gene expression in different tumor samples (file gene_expression_data.csv). 
This dataset consisted of a matrix 800 x 96: each of the 800 rows corresponded to one sample of gene expression levels; the 95 columns
containing ‘Gene’ in the name gave the expression levels of different genes (the descriptors); the column 'Type' contained acronyms denoting
the type of tumor from which each sample came from (BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD, and PRAD). First, I performed clustering through k-means
to identify groups of samples with shared gene expression patterns; next, I resorted to graph-based analysis to study the structure
of the network of co-regulation among genes that could be constructed from these expression data.
