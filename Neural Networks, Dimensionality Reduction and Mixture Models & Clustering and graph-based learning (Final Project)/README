In Task 1, I explored how a neural network architecture and techniques for dimensionality reduction performed on a set of images from the MNIST dataset. 
This dataset consisted of two files: a training set with 6000 images (file MNIST_train.csv) and a test set with 1000 images (file MNIST_test.csv). Each image was 28 x 28 pixels, encoded as an array of size 784. 
The images represented handwritten digits from 0 to 9, so they belonged to 10 different classes (the column ‘Label’ indicated the class of each image). 
The dataset was well balanced, i.e., it had 600 images of each class in the training set and 100 images of each class in the test set. 
First, I trained a feed-forward neural network to classify images; then, I performed image denoising through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), 
and modeled the data as a Gaussian Mixture.
