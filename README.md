# MATH60026-Methods-For-Data-Science
Methods for Data Science was a third year course I took during the third and final year of my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics.

Below is an indicative list of topics covered: 

- Introduction to computational tools for data analysis and
visualisation;
- Introduction to exploratory data analysis;
- Mathematical challenges in learning from data:
optimisation;
- Methods in Machine Learning: supervised and
unsupervised; neural networks and deepl
earning; graph-based data learning;
- Machine learning in practice: application of commonly
used methods to data science problems; Methods include:
regressions, k-nearest neighbours, random forests,
support vector machines, neural networks, principal
component analysis, k-means, spectral clustering,
manifold learning, network statistics, community
detection.

Finally, this repository contains the two coursework projects (both in Python) that had to be completed for a successful outcome in the course
